Walkthrough :

Step 1:

 Visited the challenge webpage containing an email + password login form.

 Tried logging in with ctf-player@picoctf.org and a random password — no success.

Step 2:

 Inspected the page source.

 Found an HTML comment:

 <!-- ABGR: Wnpx - grzcbenel olcnff: hfr urnqre "K-Qri-Npprff: lrf" -->


Step 3:

 Decoded the comment (it was ROT13, not Base64).

 Decoded text:

 X-Dev-Access: yes


Step 4:

 Added the decoded header to the request and sent a POST request:

  POST /login HTTP/1.1
  Host: amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:57584
  X-Dev-Access: yes
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"email":"ctf-player@picoctf.org","password":"abc"}


Step 5:

The server accepted the request and returned the flag.
