Description

Can you get the flag? We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag? Here's the website.

Objective :

to bypass the filter and get the flag from the files

Walkthrough :

Step 1 — Initial Analysis

 Visited the website via the link given in the decription
 Found there are three files are there in the main directory
 The website function is to read the files

Step 2 — Investigation / Enumeration

 From the description we can conclude that we are in the html folder 
 The flag might be in the previous folder ,so we have to use ../ to navigate to the previous folder

Step 3 — Exploitation / Decoding / Solving

 Crafted some payloads to read the flag 
  payloads :
    flag.txt
    ../flag.txt
    ../../flag.txt
    ../../../flag.txt
    ../../../../flag.txt

Step 4 — Retrieve the Flag

 Injected the payloads one by one and for the payload ../../../flag.txt the flag returned in the reesponse

Flag :
   picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}
