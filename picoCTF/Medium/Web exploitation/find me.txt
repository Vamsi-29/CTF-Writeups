Objective :
 
Capture the redirect responses, extract encoded flag fragments, and reconstruct the final flag.

Walkthrough :

Step 1 — Intercept Traffic

 Used Burp Suite to capture all HTTP traffic.

 Triggered an action on the website that caused a server-side redirect.

Step 2 — Analyze Redirects

 Examined 301/302 redirect responses and JavaScript-based redirects.

 Found two Base64-encoded parts of the flag inside redirect URLs:

  Part 1: cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs
  Part 2: bF90aGVfd2F5XzAxZTc0OGRifQ==


Step 3 — Combine the Fragments
 Combined both parts in the order they appeared:

 cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2FsbF90aGVfd2F5XzAxZTc0OGRifQ==


Step 4 — Decode the Combined String
 Base64 decoding the result revealed the final flag.
