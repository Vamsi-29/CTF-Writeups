Challenge -- Irish-Name-Repo 3


Description
There is a website running at http://mercury.picoctf.net:59586/ that lets people search for Irish names. We suspect it might be vulnerable to SQL Injection.

Website link: http://mercury.picoctf.net:59586/

When you visit the website, you find a search bar where users can look up Irish names.



Walkthrough:

The challenge hints at SQL Injection. By entering a single quote (') in the search field, we can test if the website is vulnerable to SQL injection. If an error appears, it means the input is directly being used in an SQL query.

To extract the database tables, we can use the UNION-based SQL injection technique. By entering:

vbnet
' UNION SELECT 1, group_concat(table_name) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database() --  
We retrieve table names. Once we find the table containing the data, we can extract column names using:

bash
' UNION SELECT 1, group_concat(column_name) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users' --  
Finally, to extract credentials from the users table:

bash
' UNION SELECT 1, group_concat(username, ':', password) FROM users --  
This reveals the credentials stored in the database. One of the extracted values will be the flag.

Steps:

Visit the website and try a basic SQL injection test (').
Use UNION SELECT to enumerate table names.
Extract column names from the relevant table.
Dump credentials and retrieve the flag.
