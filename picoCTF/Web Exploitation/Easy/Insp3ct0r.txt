Challenge: Insp3ct0r
Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection:
http://saturn.picoctf.net:63680

Walkthrough:
Analyzing the Website:
Upon visiting the provided link, a basic webpage appears with no apparent interactive elements.

Inspecting the Source Code:

Right-click on the webpage and select "Inspect" or press Ctrl + Shift + I (for Chrome/Firefox).
Check the "Elements" tab and look at the source code of the page.
We notice references to three JavaScript files:
mycss.css
myjs.js
password.js
Checking JavaScript Files:

Open myjs.js, but it does not contain anything useful.

Open password.js and find the following code:
var pass = "picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?}";
This appears to be the flag.

Steps to Solve:
Visit the challenge website: http://saturn.picoctf.net:63680.
Open Developer Tools (Inspect Element).
Navigate to the "Sources" or "Network" tab.
Locate and open password.js.
Retrieve the hidden flag.
Flag:
picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?}
