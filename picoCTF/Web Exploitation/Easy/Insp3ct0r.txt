Challenge -- Insp3ct0r
Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection.

Website link: http://saturn.picoctf.net:63680

When you visit the website, you find a simple page with no apparent functionality.

Walkthrough:

The webpage looks normal, but deeper inspection into the source code reveals hidden JavaScript files. Viewing the page source, we can see references to mycss.css, myjs.js, and password.js. Among these, password.js contains sensitive information.

Opening password.js, we find the following snippet:

var pass = "picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?}";
The flag is stored directly in the script, meaning no brute-force or cryptographic analysis is needed.

Steps:

Follow the link and visit the website.
Right-click on the page and select View Page Source.
Identify the JavaScript files linked in the source code.
Open password.js.
Extract the flag from the script.
Flag:

picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?}
